1.16 fails to build on komodo with

```
help2man: can't get `--help' info from automake-1.16                                                
Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr                                               
make: *** [doc/automake-1.16.1] Error 2
```

this is due to an outdated perl, which I REALLY don't want to build.
