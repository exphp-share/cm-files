In order to build with slurm support, you need to help it find pmi headers and libs.

`slurm-headers` below is a package containing `include/slurm`, copied from the `slurm` subdirectory of the SLURM source tarball.

```
./configure \
    --with-pmi=/home/lampam/apps/slurm-headers/2.2.4 \
    --with-pmi-libdir=/cm/shared/apps/slurm/2.2.4/lib64 \
    --prefix=/home/lampam/apps/openmpi/gcc/3.1.1/
```

Beware:  For version 3.1.1, when the ./configure script reports that it cannot find the files it is looking for, it says something like the following:

```
configure: WARNING: PMI support requested (via --with-pmi) but neither pmi.h
configure: WARNING: nor pmi2.h were found under locations:
configure: WARNING:     /usr/include/slurm
configure: WARNING:     /usr/include/slurm/slurm
configure: WARNING: Specified path: /usr/include/slurm
configure: WARNING: OR neither libpmi nor libpmi2 were found under:
configure: WARNING:     /usr/lib
configure: WARNING:     /usr/lib64
configure: WARNING: Specified path: /usr
```

Beware: This is a lie! These are not the directories it actually checked!  To figure out where it REALLY searched, look above at the standard `configure` messages:

```
checking for pmi.h in /usr/include/slurm/include... not found
checking for pmi.h in /usr/include/slurm/include/slurm... not found
checking for libpmi in /usr... not found
checking for libpmi in /usr/lib64... found
checking for PMI_Init in -lpmi... yes
```
