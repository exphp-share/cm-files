You can build this from source (I did on komodo), but on `matisse` I actually use perlbrew to maintain perl installations, so this directory isn't used.

To set up perlbrew:

```
export PERLBREW_ROOT=$HOME/.local/opt/perl5
curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
```

Then add

```
[ "$BASH" ] && source $HOME/opt/perl5/etc/bashrc
```

to `dotfiles/shell/machine/MACHINE.include`, and use

```
perlbrew install perl-5.30.0
perlbrew use perl-5.30.0
```
