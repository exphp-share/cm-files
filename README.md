# Scripts for my user Environment Modules setup

On remote systems that have Environment Modules installed (that's the thing with `mod avail`, `mod load`, etc.), I prefer to install compiled libraries to a local modulefiles prefix.

# Setup

```
cp -a apps modulefiles $HOME
```

# How to use

Look at `$HOME/apps/notes.md`
